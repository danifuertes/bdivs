# Big Data for Image and Video Signals (BDIVS)

Laboratory sessions for BDIVS subject, from the Master of Science in Signal Therory and Communications (MUTSC) of the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM).

## Instructions

If you don't have the Docker image of the laboratory session you wish to run, create it with the following command:

```bash
cd lab<n>
docker build -t cdagti/bdivs_lab<n>:latest .
```

where `n` is the number of the laboratory session. Otherwise, you can download it with this command:

```bash
docker pull cdagti/bdivs_lab<n>
```

After that, run the corresponding bash script as follows:

```bash
./bdivs_lab<n>.sh
```

Then, open this URL in your browser: `localhost:8888` and type the token/password `bdivs` to access the Jupyter Notebooks.

## How to push an image to DockerHub

To push and image to DockerHub, you must first add your username to the name of the image: `<your-username>/<image-name>`. In our case, it will be `cdagti/bdivs_lab<n>`.

In case your image has an incorrect name, you can change it with the `tag` command:

```bash
docker tag <previous-wrong-name> <new-correct-name>
```

After this, you should check the existing images with the command `docker images` and remove the wrong tag with `docker rmi <previous-wrong-name>`.

Now, you should have a docker image called `cdagti/bdivs_lab<n>`, whose version should be `latest`. If so, we will push the image to DockerHub with the next command:

```bash
docker push cdagti/bdivs_lab<n>:latest
```

With this, we have uploaded the latest version of our image. However, if we update the image in the future, we will overwrite the previous version. To ensure we mantain a version of our current image, we can do the following:

```bash
docker tag cdagti/bdivs_lab<n>:latest cdagti/bdivs_lab<n>:v0.1
docker push cdagti/bdivs_lab<n>:v0.1
```

where `v0.1` indicates that it is the first version of our image (you can use any number you prefer). With this, we have uploaded the current verion of our image (`v0.1`) and a tag that points to the latest version of our image (`latest`), which could point, in the future, to other version different from `v0.1`.
